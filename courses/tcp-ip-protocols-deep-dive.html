It has no memory of past packets. For example, you could write a rule to 'block all traffic from IP address X'.</p><h3>Stateful Firewall (Stateful Packet Inspection):</h3><p>This is a more advanced firewall that maintains a 'state table' of all active connections. It understands the context of the traffic. For example, if you make an outbound request to a website, the stateful firewall knows that a response from that website is expected. It will automatically allow the return traffic for that specific connection without needing a separate inbound rule. This is much more secure and is the standard for modern firewalls.</p>",
