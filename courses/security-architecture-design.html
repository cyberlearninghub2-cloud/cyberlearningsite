It applies segmentation policies down to the individual workload or application, drastically reducing the attack surface.</li></ul><h3>Segmentation by Function:</h3><p>A best practice is to create segments based on the function or sensitivity of the systems within them. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>User Segment:</strong> For end-user workstations.</li><li><strong>Server Segment:</strong> For general application and database servers.</li><li><strong>PCI-DSS Segment:</strong> A highly restricted zone for systems in scope for PCI compliance.</li><li><strong>Voice Segment:</strong> For VoIP phones and call managers.</li></ul>",

Use them for broad blocking rules (e.g., block all traffic from a known malicious IP range).</li><li><strong>Routing Tables:</strong> Control the flow of traffic between subnets and to the internet.

This is the preferred method for production workloads.</li></ul><h3>Shared Services VPC / Hub-and-Spoke Model:</h3><p>A common architecture is to create a central 'Hub' VPC that handles all external connectivity (VPN, Direct Connect, Internet Egress). This Hub VPC contains shared security services like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Other application VPCs ('Spokes') are then connected to the Hub via VPC Peering or a Transit Gateway. This centralizes security control and inspection.</p>",

Instead, it uses IEEE 802.1X, which requires each user to authenticate with their own unique credentials, typically against a RADIUS server (e.g., integrated with Active Directory).</li><li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> A wireless network should never be bridged directly onto the trusted corporate LAN. At a minimum, it should be on its own segmented VLAN. Best practice is to have multiple wireless networks (SSIDs) mapped to different VLANs:<ul><li><strong>Corporate SSID:</strong> For company-owned devices, using WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise. Grants access to internal resources.</li><li><strong>BYOD SSID:</strong> For employee-owned devices. May use Enterprise or PSK authentication, and places users on a restricted VLAN.</li><li><strong>Guest SSID:</strong> For visitors. Always uses a simple captive portal for authentication and is completely isolated, with internet-only access.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Intrusion Prevention (WIPS):</strong> Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems monitor the radio spectrum for threats like rogue access points, evil twins, and de-authentication attacks.</li></ul>",

Corporate apps and data (email, documents) live inside this container and are isolated from the user's personal apps and data.

An API endpoint allows an attacker to access or manipulate an object (e.g., another user's account) that they should not have access to, simply by changing the ID in the API call. Mitigation: Strong, centralized authorization checks on every request.</li><li><strong>API2: Broken Authentication:</strong> Weak or improperly implemented authentication that allows attackers to compromise authentication tokens or impersonate other users. Mitigation: Use standard, robust protocols like OAuth 2.0.</li><li><strong>API3: Excessive Data Exposure:</strong> The API returns more data in a response than is needed by the UI, potentially exposing sensitive information. Mitigation: Design APIs to return only the necessary data for a given request.</li><li><strong>API4: Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting:</strong> The API does not restrict the rate or size of requests, making it vulnerable to denial-of-service or brute-force attacks. Mitigation: Implement rate limiting at the API Gateway.</li><li><strong>API5: Broken Function Level Authorization:</strong> A user is able to access administrative functions that their role should not permit. Mitigation: Granular authorization checks based on user roles and permissions.</li></ul>",

It adds a crucial piece: identity.

It is 'transparent' because the database engine handles all encryption and decryption automatically. It protects against theft of the physical disks or backup tapes. It does not protect against a malicious DBA who has access to the running database.</li><li><strong>Column-Level Encryption:</strong> Allows specific columns containing sensitive data (e.g., a 'credit_card_number' column) to be encrypted.

The database only ever sees the encrypted ciphertext. This provides the highest level of security but is the most complex to implement.</li></ul><h3>Key Management Architecture:</h3><p>The security of the encryption depends entirely on the security of the encryption keys.

Grant permissions to roles, and then assign users or application accounts to those roles.</li><li><strong>Least Privilege for Applications:</strong> An application service account should only have the bare minimum permissions it needs. If an application only reads data, its account should only have `SELECT` permissions on the specific tables and views it needs.

KMS Policy Check:\n     - The KMS checks its policy: 'Is this Application's identity allowed to *use* CustomerDataDEK?'\n     - The KMS does NOT return the key itself.\n\n  3. Encryption Process:\n     - The Application has a new piece of customer data to store.\n     - It sends an API call to the KMS: 'Please encrypt this plaintext data using CustomerDataDEK'.\n     - The KMS forwards this request to its backend Hardware Security Module (HSM).\n     - The HSM, where CustomerDataDEK is securely stored, performs the encryption.\n     - The HSM returns the resulting ciphertext to the KMS.\n     - The KMS returns the ciphertext to the Application.\n     - The Application stores the ciphertext in the database.\n\n  4.

Use RBAC within the data warehouse to control access. Create roles for data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers with appropriate permissions.</li><li><strong>Network Controls:</strong> Configure the data warehouse to be accessible only from trusted networks (e.g., your corporate network or specific VPCs) using private endpoints or IP allow-lists. Block all public access.</li><li><strong>Column-level Security and Data Masking:</strong> This is a critical feature for protecting sensitive PII. It allows you to create policies that mask or hide specific columns based on the user's role. For example, a data analyst might see a masked credit card number (`****-****-****-1234`), while a fraud investigator in a privileged role can see the full number.</li><li><strong>Row-level Security:</strong> This filters the rows a user is able to see based on their attributes.

Enabling encryption would require a full application rewrite, which is not feasible within the project timeline.\n- **Compensating Controls Proposed:** \n  1. The database server will be placed in a highly isolated network segment with a firewall that only allows access from the specific application server.\n  2. A Database Activity Monitor (DAM) will be deployed to monitor all access to the data in real-time.\n  3. The underlying storage volume for the database will be encrypted at the disk level.\n- **Risk Assessment:** The residual risk of data exposure from physical media theft is mitigated by disk encryption. The risk of unauthorized access is mitigated by network isolation and enhanced monitoring. The risk is assessed as 'Medium'.\n- **Exception Duration:** 12 months, at which point the application is scheduled for decommissioning.\n\n--- **ARB Decision Section** ---\n- **Decision:** Approved\n- **Rationale:** The proposed compensating controls adequately reduce the risk to an acceptable level for the requested duration.\n- **Action Item:** Log this as 'architectural debt' to be tracked for remediation or decommissioning in 12 months."
