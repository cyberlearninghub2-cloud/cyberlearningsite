They approach the application just like an external attacker would, with no source code or architecture diagrams. This simulates an external attack.</li><li><strong>White-Box Testing:</strong> The tester has complete access to all information, including source code, design documents, and infrastructure details. This allows for the most thorough analysis, such as a manual code review, to find flaws that would be invisible from the outside.</li><li><strong>Gray-Box Testing:</strong> A hybrid approach. The tester has some limited knowledge, such as user-level credentials or some information about the application's architecture. This can simulate an insider threat or an attack where the adversary has already gained a foothold.</li></ul>",

Threat modeling is a structured process done *during the design phase* to proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats.</p><h3>The Threat Modeling Process:</h3><ol><li><strong>Decompose the Application:</strong> Diagram the architecture and the data flows.</li><li><strong>Identify Threats:</strong> For each component and data flow, brainstorm what could go wrong. A framework like STRIDE can be used here.</li><li><strong>Determine Mitigations:</strong> For each threat, propose a security control to mitigate it.</li></ol><p>Doing this exercise *before* writing code allows you to build security into the design from the start, which is far cheaper and more effective than trying to bolt it on at the end.</p>",

The server 'reflects' the malicious script from the URL back into the HTML of the search results page, and the victim's browser executes it.</li><li><strong>Stored XSS (Persistent XSS):</strong> This is the most dangerous type. The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database comment field or a user profile page. When any user visits that page, their browser will fetch and execute the stored script. A single stored XSS payload can impact every user who views the affected page.</li></ul>",
