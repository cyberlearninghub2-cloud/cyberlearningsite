Only the application with the matching UID can access its own data.</li></ul><p>This sandbox model is the primary defense against malicious applications trying to steal data from legitimate applications on the same device.</p>",

The user was presented with a list of all requested permissions at install time and had to accept them all to install the app.</li><li><strong>Runtime Permissions (Modern):</strong> For dangerous permissions, the application must ask the user for permission the first time it needs to access the resource (e.g., a pop-up asking for camera access).
