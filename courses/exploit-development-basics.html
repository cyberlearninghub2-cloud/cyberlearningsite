The OS marks regions of memory that should only contain data (like the stack and the heap) as 'non-executable'. If an attacker injects shellcode onto the stack and tries to jump to it, the CPU will refuse to execute it and the program will crash. This defeats simple shellcode injection.</li><li><strong>ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization):</strong> The OS randomizes the base addresses of key memory regions (like the stack, heap, and loaded libraries) each time a program is run. This means an attacker can no longer rely on a hardcoded address for their exploit; they must first find a way to leak an address to figure out where everything is.</li><li><strong>Stack Canaries:</strong> A secret, random value (the 'canary') is placed on the stack before the saved return address. Before a function returns, it checks if the canary value is still intact. A classic buffer overflow will overwrite the canary. When the check fails, the program exits safely, preventing the attacker from taking control of EIP.</li></ul>",

The saved return address is located 12 bytes above it on the stack. An attacker provides an input that consists of 100 bytes of junk ('A's), followed by 8 bytes of padding, followed by the 4-byte address of their malicious shellcode. The `strcpy` function copies all 112 bytes, overflowing the buffer and overwriting the saved EBP and EIP.

They integrate a fuzzing framework into their CI/CD pipeline. Every time a developer commits new code, the system automatically builds the program and then starts a fuzzing campaign against it that runs for several hours in the cloud. If the fuzzer finds a crash, it automatically files a bug report with all the details (the input that caused the crash, the stack trace, etc.) and assigns it to the developer. This process, called 'DevSecOps', finds vulnerabilities automatically and continuously, long before the software is ever released to the public.</p>",

Executive Summary\nA critical stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the 'LOGIN' command handler of the Cool Web Server v1.2. This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution as the root user.\n\n## 2. Technical Details\n\n*   **Vulnerability:** Stack Buffer Overflow\n*   **Affected Function:** `handle_login()`\n*   **Root Cause:** The server uses an unsafe `strcpy()` to copy the user-provided username into a 256-byte fixed-size buffer on the stack without performing any bounds checking.\n\n## 3. Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates the vulnerability. It sends a specially crafted 'LOGIN' command that overwrites the saved return address on the stack and redirects execution to a payload that will launch a reverse shell back to the attacker.\n\n```python\n# (Include the working exploit script here)\n```\n\n## 4. Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a complete compromise of the underlying server, allowing an attacker to steal data, install a rootkit, or use the server to attack other systems.\n\n## 5. Recommended Mitigation\n\nThe `strcpy()` function in `handle_login()` should be replaced with a bounds-checked alternative, such as `strncpy()` or `snprintf`."

The attacker can use this token to ask the Kubernetes API to schedule a new pod on one of the cluster's nodes. In the definition for this new pod, they specify that the host's root file system (`/`) should be mounted into the pod at `/host`.

This is not a flaw in AWS; it is a user misconfiguration, but it is one of the most common causes of major data breaches.</p>",

They find that one of the roles it can pass is a highly privileged 'Administrator' role. They can then create a new service (like a Lambda function), attach the Administrator role to it, and use that service to execute commands as a full admin.</li><li><strong>Editing Policy Versions:</strong> An attacker compromises a user who has permission to edit IAM policies, but not create new ones. The user has a restrictive policy attached. The attacker can edit the policy, add `\"*\":\"*\"` to give themselves full admin rights, and then change it back, making their activity much harder to spot.</li></ul>",

They use an SDR to record the radio signal that is sent when the legitimate owner presses the 'unlock' button. The attacker can then simply re-transmit this captured signal to unlock the car themselves. This is a basic 'replay attack'. More advanced 'rolling code' systems are used to defeat this, but they can also have vulnerabilities that allow for prediction or desynchronization attacks, which can be executed with an SDR.</p>",
