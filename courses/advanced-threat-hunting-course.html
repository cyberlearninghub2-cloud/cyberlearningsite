Mostly automated searching for known-bad indicators.\n- **Level 2 (Procedural):** Follows analysis procedures created by others. Can perform basic hunts but relies on established playbooks.\n- **Level 3 (Innovative):** Can create new data analysis procedures. Develops new hypotheses based on threat reports. This is the goal for an advanced hunter.\n- **Level 4 (Leading):** Automates the majority of successful hunt procedures. The hunt process continuously improves the automated detection capabilities of the organization."
