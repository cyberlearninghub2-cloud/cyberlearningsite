In a disaster, the entire environment is rebuilt in the secondary cloud and restored from backup. This is low-cost but has a high RTO/RPO.</li><li><strong>Pilot Light / Warm Standby:</strong> A minimal or full-scale version of the infrastructure is kept running in the secondary cloud, with data being actively replicated. In a disaster, a failover is initiated to redirect traffic to the standby site. This offers a much lower RTO/RPO but is more expensive.</li><li><strong>Active-Active:</strong> The application runs simultaneously in both clouds, with a global load balancer distributing traffic.

Each has a native logging service, but we lack a unified view for security monitoring and threat hunting, which creates significant visibility gaps and operational inefficiency for the SOC.\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will adopt Microsoft Sentinel as our primary, multi-cloud SIEM. We will forward all critical security logs from AWS (CloudTrail, GuardDuty) and GCP (Cloud Audit Logs, SCC) to a central Sentinel workspace.\n\n## Consequences\n\n- **Positive:** We gain a single pane of glass for security analytics. We can leverage Sentinel's built-in UEBA and SOAR capabilities. Deep integration with our existing Azure and Microsoft 365 environments will be seamless.\n- **Negative:** There will be data egress costs for shipping logs from AWS and GCP into Azure. The SOC team will need to be trained on Sentinel's Kusto Query Language (KQL).\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Splunk Cloud:** Considered a leader but the projected cost for ingesting our high volume of cloud logs was prohibitive.\n- **AWS-native SIEM:** We considered building a solution around Amazon OpenSearch, but this would require significant engineering effort to build the correlation and analytics layer."
