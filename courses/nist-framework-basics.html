[19, 38] In cybersecurity, NIST has become a global standard, developing influential guidelines and best practices to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. [5, 19] Its standards are foundational to strategic security planning and are widely adopted by both federal agencies and private sector companies worldwide.

[17, 25] This order directed NIST to work with the private sector to establish a voluntary framework based on existing standards and best practices. [25] Through extensive collaboration with industry, academia, and government agencies, the first version of the Framework (Version 1.0) was published in 2014. [2, 17] An update, Version 1.1, was released in April 2018 to include guidance on supply chain risk management. [2, 33] The most significant update, CSF 2.0, was released in February 2024, expanding the framework's scope and adding a new 'Govern' function.

[9, 16] The framework is flexible and adaptable, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes and industries.

Regular reporting and meetings ensure that risk management is an ongoing process and that decisions are reviewed as the threat landscape and business objectives change.</p><h3>Elements of Good Communication:</h3><ul><li><strong>Common Language:</strong> Using frameworks like the NIST CSF helps create a shared vocabulary.

This is often managed through a 'Joiner, Mover, Leaver' process.</p><h3>Phases of the Lifecycle:</h3><ul><li><strong>Joiner (Provisioning):</strong> A new user (employee, contractor) joins the organization. An identity is created, and initial access is granted based on their role.</li><li><strong>Mover (Modification):</strong> The user changes roles within the organization. Their access rights are modified, revoking permissions they no longer need and granting new ones.</li><li><strong>Leaver (Deprovisioning):</strong> The user leaves the organization.

Strong authentication, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), is a foundational component of modern access control.</p><h3>Common Access Control Models:</h3><ul><li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC):</strong> The most restrictive model, where access is determined by security labels. The operating system enforces access rules. Common in military and government systems.</li><li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC):</strong> The resource owner determines who has access. This is the model used in standard file systems like Windows and Linux (e.g., you can set permissions on your own files).</li><li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> The most common model in corporate environments. Access is assigned based on a user's job role (e.g., 'Accountant', 'Sales Rep'). Users are assigned to roles, and permissions are assigned to the roles.</li></ul>",

This is about keeping secrets secret. The primary control for confidentiality is <strong>encryption</strong>.</li><li><strong>Integrity (PR.DS-1):</strong> Maintains and assures the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. It ensures that data has not been improperly modified. Controls for integrity include <strong>hashing</strong> and access controls.</li><li><strong>Availability (PR.DS-1):</strong> Ensures that data is accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized party. This is about preventing disruption of access to data. Controls for availability include <strong>backups</strong>, redundancy, and fault tolerance.</li></ul><div class=\"info-box tip\"><div class=\"info-box-header\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i><strong>Balancing the Triad</strong></div><p>Sometimes, controls that enhance one pillar can affect another.

Not all anomalies are malicious—they could be a legitimate but unusual activity—but they all warrant investigation.</p><h3>Types of Anomaly Detection:</h3><ul><li><strong>Signature-Based Detection:</strong> This is the traditional method, used by antivirus and older IDS. It looks for known patterns or 'signatures' of malicious activity. It's effective for known threats but cannot detect new attacks.</li><li><strong>Behavior-Based Detection:</strong> This is the core of modern anomaly detection.

Of the 50 active users, there is no documented evidence that access reviews were completed for 15 of those users in either quarter.\n\n  Cause: The process for tracking the completion of access reviews is manual and relies on email. There is no automated reminder or escalation process.\n\n  Impact: There is a risk that users who have changed roles or no longer need access still retain privileged access to a critical financial system, violating the principle of least privilege.\n\n  Recommendation: Implement a feature in the identity management system to automate the quarterly access review and certification process, including reminders and escalations to management."
