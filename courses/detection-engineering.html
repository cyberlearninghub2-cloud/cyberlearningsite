An attacker performing this activity will likely generate a large number of these events from a single source host in a short period of time, for multiple different service accounts.\n\n- **Primary Log Source:** Windows Security Event Log (Event ID 4769).\n\n- **Detection Logic:** \n  - Aggregate 4769 events by the source IP address.\n  - Alert if a single source IP requests tickets for an unusually high number of distinct service accounts within a 1-hour window.\n\n- **Known False Positives:** Some vulnerability scanners and administrative tools may exhibit similar behavior.
