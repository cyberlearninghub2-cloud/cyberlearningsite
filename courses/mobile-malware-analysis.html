However, this also means users can easily install applications from untrusted, third-party app stores or directly from the web ('sideloading'). This is the #1 infection vector for Android malware.</li><li><strong>Platform Fragmentation:</strong> With thousands of different devices from hundreds of manufacturers, many Android devices do not receive timely security updates, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits.</li></ul><h3>iOS Malware: Rare but High-Impact</h3><ul><li><strong>Closed Ecosystem ('Walled Garden'):</strong> iOS is a tightly controlled platform. By default, users can only install apps from the official App Store, where Apple performs a security review. This makes widespread malware infections very difficult.</li><li><strong>Primary Vectors:</strong> iOS malware typically relies on very high-end, targeted attacks (e.g., zero-day exploits that can cost millions of dollars) or abuses enterprise certificates to sideload apps onto non-jailbroken devices in a corporate environment.</li></ul>",
